# Experimentation with NextJS

This is my attempt to build a front-end of an entertainment web app, with designs provided by Frontend Mentor.

I plan to learn the following things via this challenge:

1. Build confidence and familiarize with building NextJS apps, starting from this frontend-focused challenge
2. Familiarize with core react concepts (hooks, effects) and learn best practices
3. Build familiarity and learn-on-the-go of CSS concepts (esp flex and grid layouts)

## Progress-check

### Day 1-2

Managed to build out the SideNav component, including the avatar, logo, and nav links.

### Day 3

Learnt that in module CSS, must always start with a class reference, but can then continue with a normal html tag like this:

.someClass div { ... }
